# Auto Splitter for ***Door Kickers: Action Squad***
## Features
Starts the timer when the player enters a level.  
Splits upon finishing a level when – depending on the user's settings – either all or a variable amount of stars have been awarded.  
Resets the timer upon failing a mission or resetting the level – depending on the user's settings.

This autosplitter additionally logs successful and failed missions to a file, complete with chapter number, level number, whether the level was successful or failed, the time and the amount of hostages and arrest targets and their respective totals.
