# Auto Splitter for ***Lightmatter***
## Features
Starts the timer when any level is chosen from the main menu.  
Splits every time a level is finished and when the final switch is pressed.  
Resets the timer when quitting to the main menu from any level.  
Syncs to in-game time.

Additionally, there is an "IL mode" in the settings: restarts the timer when pressing "Retry" in a level and splits when finishing one.
